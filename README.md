# MovieScheduling-
Movie freak Akshay Kumar took a day off from work to just to watch movies. At 8AM in the morning, he walks into the nearest movie hall and gets the schedule for the day.

Write a Java program that will generate the combination of the maximum number of distinct movies Simon can watch on that day.

The show calendar is as below.

Example:

Movie 1: 10-12,1-3,3-5,7-9
Movie 2: 11-1,1-3,3-5,7-9
Movie 3: 8-10,10-12,4-6,8-10
Movie 4: 12-3,4-7,8-11
Movie 5: 12-1,2-3,3-4,5-6,8-9,11-12
Movie 6: 1-4,5-8,9-12
